Cluster simulator is a browser-based game where you try and manager clusters to your best
ability. You start off with a set amount of money to buy your starting gear and work your
way from there. Over time, servers break down, loads increase and software becomes out-dated.
It's your job to keep things running!.

This game is made with Angular 6 and Python 3.
